## What I leant from the tasks 
I learned that a good README helps others understand what the project is about exactly and procedures on how to install it, and also how to use it.

## N'GOVERNMENT APPLICATION
**This is going to be sort of a complex job, because it's going to be a nationwide application whereby all one needs is one's E-mail and National ID.**

Here are some of the activities it shall entail for registered citizens:
1. *Citizens will be given access to vote only during elections instead of going to polling centres and as a citizen you can even track the vote count by yourself. I beleive that with this we can substantially alleviate electoral malpratice.*
2. _I believe that by giving access to connect to one's bank account. If there is any need for government loan or gifts, stuffs like that, it would be easily distributed per person._
